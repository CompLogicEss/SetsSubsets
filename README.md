# SetsSubsets

This notebook works through some of the question from tutorial 5 on sets and
subsets. Click on the binder link below to open it in interactive mode: this
will allow you to edit the code snippets and play around with elements and
subsets yourself. Alternatively you can click on the filename above and read the
file with all the code run already.
